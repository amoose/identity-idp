        Until we can verify your identity, you cannot use a Upaya online account to change your U.S.
        mailing address or view your case history.  However, you can still track the status of your
        Green Card through <a href="https://egov.upaya.gov/casestatus/landing.do">Case Status Online</a>.
        You will need your Upaya Receipt Number to get the status of your case. The receipt number
        will begin with the letters "IOE." You can also change your address with Upaya by visiting
        the <a href="https://egov.upaya.gov/coa/displayCOAInitForm.do">Change of Address</a>
        website.
